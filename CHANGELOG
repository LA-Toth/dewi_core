    features but the original Application's parameters are also added
  - Application: listing commands use minimal screen width (bugfix)

    if command is not found
  - Add SimpleApplication: no loader, just the program name and a plugin name
  - Update examples
  - Remove Plugin.get_description(), it was never used. It does not break any
    plugin having this method. Using docstring instead.

2.0
  - !!! DEWI goes into multiple repositories and packages
  - use only 'protected' members with single leading underscore ('_')
  - MainApplication: argparse.Namespace object's 'protected', custom
    members end with '_' instead of leading '_', as they are touched
    from MainApplication and can be read anywhere
  - Plugin: add '_r()' for simpler command registration,
    removed default depenency - it's empty list
  - Keep logger, config, plugin, and MainApplication classes with their
    dependencies, others are in different packages

1.5
  - MainApplication: --debug implies --log-level debug
    default log level: info
  - images/filedb: add count() to count entries in photo_file_info table
  - images related commands: use exiftool-5.26 as MacPorts updated it
  - safe_delete_images: handle Exceptions at unlink(), mainly PermissionErrors
  - add further log_*() calls into dewi.rrdtool & realtime_sync

1.4
  - pretty-print output command list (e.g. 'list-all')
  - add dewi.utils.archive, which contains an UnZip class to (partially) unzip
    .zip files
  - if a command is mistyped or non-existing, print at most 6 similar command
    names, or list all of them
  - dewi.images.filedb: add rollback() method to FileDatabase
  - dewi.core.context: Context got 'commands' and 'command_registry'
    properties, and always contains the corresponding 'commands' and
    'commandregistry' fields

  - rrdtool: use NodeList & fix modifiers
  - NetworkCardVendors: add option to prevent network usage
  - logparsers: add support to add multiple callbacks to a pattern:
    during log processing one pattern matching - multiple calls.

  - dewi.utils.yaml: add the module to save a dict to a YAML file
  - config/node.py: add Node.load_from() to load from a dict (from eg. YAML);
  - config/node: __setattr__ checks whether key is already in the node
